# ionic2SampleTabs
This samples shows using ng2-translate, Tabs, Slides, and FABs.


Getting Started:

Make sure you have the latest Node.js, Cordova and Ionic 2.  This is what I am running:

Cordova CLI: 6.4.0 
Ionic Framework Version: 2.0.0-rc.2
Ionic CLI Version: 2.1.13
Ionic App Lib Version: 2.1.7
Ionic App Scripts Version: 0.0.45
ios-deploy version: 1.9.0 
ios-sim version: 3.1.1 
OS: macOS Sierra
Node Version: v6.9.2
Xcode version: Xcode 8.1 Build version 8B62

After you have the latest versions installed, or at least the version I have listed above, then you probably need to run the following so that the hooks run properly.

chmod +x hooks

Next add your platform:

ionic platform add {{ios|android}}

If all works, then you should be able to deploy to the device, run ionic serve, etc...
